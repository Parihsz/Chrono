# Config
Configs on how chronos works. This can be modified pre-runtime or at runtime before initialization.

:::danger
Remember to modify the config on both the server and client.
:::

:::danger
Only the properties `NPC_MODELS` and `NPC_TYPES` may be modified after `Chrono.Start()` is called, otherwise an error would occur. Other properties must be modified before running `Chrono.Start()`.

## Types

### `NPC_CONFIG`

| Field     | Type   | Description              |
|----------|-------|--------------------------|
| `TICK_RATE`      | number | The tick rate for the npc   |
| `BUFFER`  | number    | the buffer time for the npc |

---

## Properties

### `MIN_BUFFER: number`

The minimum buffer time for snapshots.

---

### `MAX_BUFFER: number`

The maximum buffer time for snapshots.

---

### `PROXIMITY: number`

The proximity threshold in studs where TICK_RATE is applied.

---

### `ENABLE_CUSTOM_CHARACTERS: boolean`
If true, allows the use of custom characters in the game. This will disable default roblox replication as well.

---

### `DISABLE_DEFAULT_REPLICATION: boolean`
If true, disables default roblox replication for players.

:::danger
This will also prevent you from anchoring the primary part of player characters as chrono would be unanchoring locally so they can move as they are anchored on the server to prevent replication.
:::

---

### `SEND_FULL_ROTATION: boolean`
If true, clients and server will replicate **full 3D rotation** (as 3Ã— mapped `u16` values).  
If false (default), only yaw rotation is sent.  
This property can be modified during as chrono is running. 

:::note
Full rotation packets are slightly larger (**24 bytes**) compared to yaw-only packets (**20 bytes**).
:::

---

### `SHOW_WARNINGS: boolean`
If true, enables the display of common warnings in the console.

---

### `NPC_MODELS: { [string]: Model }`
A mapping of NPC model names to models that will be cloned.

---

### `NPC_TYPES: {[string]: NPC_CONFIG}`
A mapping of NPC types to their configuration.
